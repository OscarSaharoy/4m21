Design

everything is designed
	dont miss the fact that someone has to think through everything
	lots of ways to think about design

design matters
	because people need to use them
	affects the way we use and remember things
	makes things usable or unusable
	small improvements generate huge effect

	catalyst for innovation
	makes things more efficient and fair

ultimate particular
	concept or plan that realises idea
	we can observe how it works with users
	set your possible worlds
	new ways of doing things

	people create novel and valuable ideas

design
	solving problems
	need decisions and plans
	to answer thousands of interconnected problems
	iteration makes it faster and easier
	optimal design is naive due to tradeoffs

research through design
	a new design represents new information about a possible way to do things

design has transformative potential
	can change how people do things
	new meaning in life
	solutionism - fixing problems
	more about enabling new possibilities
	of how things could be

design probes
	how do you combine user research
	send objects to people and ask how they choose to use them
	enable new ways to interact

design in HCI
	dont worry about technical details but how to use them
	and its human centered
	design decisions are based on understanding users
	designer is interacting with the artefact using design knowledge
	knowledge is found iteratively by feedback from users

user centered
	focus on users goals
	have user involvement
	prototyping to evaluate ideas
		in context
	hollistic design - think about entire system and lifetime

rationales for design
	want to improve things
	want to create new things
	want to produce new knowledge

problem solving
	need to figure out problem then solve it
	identify lots of solutions and evaluate them
	use experience
	designers use memory as well as existing artefacts
	representation
		frame a problem in the best way to find the solution
	
design thinking
	anyone can do design
	comes from uk design council
	double diamond
	divergent thinking and then convergent
	discover what can be done - div
	then evaluate options - conv
	then think how to develop solution - div
	then deliver - conv

	creation is divergent
	evaluation is convergent

value sensitive design
	want to design things that respect values
	need to make values explicit so they can be taken into account
	costs a lot of money if missed
	need accountability
	need to measure it and use user research to discover values
	evaluate based on values
	lots of designs that shouldnt be done
	critical design helps identify what should be solved

design cognition
	convergent and divergent thinking
	need to know when to converge or diverge
	problems need to be refined as they are usually ill stated
	need to reorganise your thoughts eg by sketching

	iteration is needed for a good design
	tight coupling between problems and solutions
		a good solution solves a hard problem
	know when to explore and when to evaluate
	effect of experience
		experts often generate less ideas of higher quality

heuristic thinking
	availability heuristic - what comes to mind
	heuristics create bias so are bad for design
	bias gives undue weight to certain ideas
	and misses others
	availabilty
	anchoring
		dont explore beyond near a known solution
	decoying
		cant see solution behind a reference one
	status quo
		follow norms
	bandwagon
		follow other people
	
fixation
	fixed on a certain solution
	cant explore around others
	
	everyone has it
	hard to break out of it
	sunk cost fallacy with a developed idea

	need to try to break it
	wacky references to inspire new thought
	creative breaks
	computational methods
	inspiration from art/nature

generating solutions
	need to understand the problem
	proper problem has
		design decisions
		design space
			set of decisions
		objectives
			what makes a design acceptable
		constraints
			budget etc
	need to refine problem to have those 4

	ideally optimisation techniques can be used
	usually doesnt work
	many problems are too vague and not formal

creativity
	element of surprise, novel or insightful
	biases get in the way
	need to be both novel and valuable

creative thinking
	quantity drives quality

ideation methods
	idea generation methods
	brainstorming
		postpone criticism to avoid bias
		need quantity and range
		accumulation of knowledge by building on ideas
		every idea has the same value
	sketching
	expansion - generate alternatives
	then critique

	crazyness - how wide ideas do we seek - more wide but maybe lower quality
	number of people & moderator - need to make sure people arent becoming biased
	use of different representations

ill defined and wicked problems
	design tasks which are ambiguous
	cant really solve a problem that isnt defined
	no clear goals and too many constraints
	fails to capture example solution
	ill defined problem can be improved
	wicked problems cant be
		eg fix poverty
	
goal refinement
	relax assumptions
	study organisation
	ensure objectives and constraints are workable
	and need to make sure everyone is on the same page
	need to get a stopping rule

sketching
	convergent and divergent
	can make a large quantity and refine an idea too
	clear visual conventions
	needs to show what is relevant and no more

design practice

design is complex
	need to stay creative
	objectives and constraints
	uncertainty
	contextual factors
	starholders
	multi disciplinary and collaborative

practice of user involvement
	hard to be user centered
	8 weeks of observation
	found
	need to motivate stakeholders
	figure out what users need
	nominate a chamption of user involvement
	keep users engaged
	manage expectations

spheres of design practice

prototyping
	find feasability of ideas
	present concrete thing to stakeholders
	different fidelity level prototypes depending on design stage

	low fidelity
		can make a large quantity and learn 
	
reflection and critique
	designers come together and reflect
	iterative

collaboration
	need shared language
	and to listen to everyone

improving design in organisations: design thinking
	defining problem is more valuable than trying to solve them
	early focus on users helps mitigate risk of innovation failure
	iteration is needed

communities of practice
	group of people who share an interest and meet to help improve
	design systems
		ensure high quality designs
		frame users values

design process

user centered design process
	eg waterfall
		but no iteration

usability engineering
	lifecycle model
		helps support and maintain too
	but doesnt help creativity
	no theory

	10 steps

agile
	embrace new knowledge

human factors
	like usability but focused on safety
	needed for safety critical systems
	uses root cause analysis and psychological factors
	seeks to reduce human error
