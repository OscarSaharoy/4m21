nielsens heuristics
	current state should be visible to user

input
	direct control
		eg touch screen
		implement directly contacts screen
		light pen
		resistive touchscreen
		capacitive touchscreen
			allow multitouch
			better response time
			worse precision
			need processing

	diamondtouch
		people touhcing screen on table
		touching screen closes a circuit
		capacitances from the table/finger and chair in series
		antennas in table
	
	frustrated total internal reflection
		edge lit pane
		angle set up so that the light is trapped inside
		when you touch it you frustrate the light and it can escape
		detect using computer vision

	indirect control
		mouse or touchpad
		C:D ratio is ratio of eg mouse movement to pointer movement

	uncertain control
		not certain of user intention
		eg accelerometers
		eyebrow switch

	eye tracking
		estiate users gaze by monitoring eyeball
		can use camera but need callibration
		can send IR light towards eye and is then reflected in a certain way that can be recognised
	
	hand and finger
		can put instruments on fingers
			markers on fingers tracked by cameras
		lab experiments only
		hand tracking by computer vision or depth camera
		can create hand skeletons as a low dimensional representation that can be used

output
	displays
		multi displays
		multi modal displays
		tactile display on tongue

	visual encoding
		how to communicate variables to user
		visual marks
			points lines areas
		visual channels
			relative position colour shape orientation

	haptics
		can touch and feel
		forces on body
		vibration
		or force feedback
	
	exoskeleton gloves
		motors work against muscles
		to give resistance
		monitoring finger movements
		simulated normal force
		can also feel squishyness and bounceback

		can also be grounded to simulate gravity

		telerobotics
			training medics or military
		can also give haptic guidance for the blind
			helps find and avoid things just out of reach
			camera tracks objects using internal simulation and tactor shows proximity to objects

interaction
	a computation that couples input and output
	performance experience learnability mobility ergonomics accessibility

bubble cursor
	big cursor to increase W in fitts law
	but area cursor can select multiple
	bubble cursor computes voronoi tesselation
	cursor grows to encompass only 1 target
	but too many targets on screen at once to be useful

pie menus
	can also be nested
	press a button then sliding selects
	limited by number of slices

marking menu
	refinement of pie
	continuous transition
	push down to open menu
	unique trace for each selection
	recognises traces as user learns the gestures naturally
	natural transition from closed to open loop control

text entry
	want to make it intelligent
	word prediction etc
	crowdsourced study
		2 thumb typing is fastest
		costly to correct errors
		also about visual control
		many users struggle with keyboards
		
	gesture typing!!
		allows memory of gestures for each word
		always there is some motor memory consolidation
		not looking at keys = open loop
		even works with scrambled keyboard
		starts easy and this helps consolidation
	

commands
	command naming
		used to be area of research
		hard to consistently name commands
	polysemy
		same word may mean different things to different people
	context

	ellictation study to get suggestions or pick names from peoples daily lives	

CLI
	prompt command parameters
	hard to name commands
	parameters are syntax - can be hard to learn and use

	how do you know which commands are available
	and name them
	how can people learn commands
	recall of parameters and syntax
	transparency - need to give feedback during operation and interpretation
		need to know what is acheivable and diagnose why something might not work

hypertext
	clickable links
menus
	good for explorability but bad for expert performance
	so use shortcuts but hard to learn
		studies show most people dont use them

notational systems
	eg a spreadsheet  which has a certain syntax
	controls for central heating, google nest

	incrementation
	transcription
	modification
	exploration
	search
	exploratory understanding

ring to control central heating
	stroke ring to control heat
	feedback through lighting
	normal lighting is proportional to current temp
	poor visibilty
	mapping is close and far from the task
	roll expressiveness is unclear
	sets temperature in future
	so there is a  hidden dependancy (target temp rather than current)

GUIs
	first xerox wimp
	why is it organised that way
	can have physics based GUI desktop - bumptop
	visibility
		what you see is what you get
		see as it will be printed
	visibility of commands, status and dependancies
		eg color coding on excel cells
	consistencu
