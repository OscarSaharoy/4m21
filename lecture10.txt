Driving while using phone
	sharing attention
	less fine motor control
	less thinking - based on icon recognition
	basic psychological needs
	immersion is less, easy to jump in and out
	communication?

game
	dedicated attention
	fine motor control
	keep track of game state etc
	very immersive experience
	communication with other players & inference of other players goals

types of understanding
	theories
		constructs and relations
		help explain
	concepts
		name phenomena
		& how to identify
	taxonomies
		system of elements or mechanisms
	models
		simplifications of reality
		to make predictions
	guidelines
		theoretical knowledge distilled into something actionable
		rules of thumb

areas of understanding
	perception
	motor control
	cognition
	needs
	experience
	communication
	collaboration

HCI values actionable knowledge
	knowledge: explaining and predicting how people use computers
	considering what to build
	investigate impacts of a system on eg a community

understanding of people can
	direct our attention
	explain empirical findings
	make design decisions
	explore a design space
	predict people's behaviour

perception
	allows user to determine input
	and allows UI to give feedback to user

	comes from
		expectation
			estimation based on previous experience
		attention
			decide which sensory information to consider
		sensory information
			recognise changes in environment
	
	transduction
		mechanical
		chemical
		photo
		
		vision
			high bandwidth
			parallel
		hearing
			serial
			faster than others
		tactation
			limited to areas of physical contact

	need to consider
		information rate
		parallelism
		sensitivity
		receptive field
		adaptation
			tuning out noise

	perceptual tasks
		discrimination
		detection
		recognition
		estimarion
		search
	
	visbility
		wavelength
		field of view
		contrast
		foveation
	
		these limit eg looking at a smart watch while tying shoelaces
	
	eye movement
		fixations
			stabilisation on target
		saccade
			ballistic leap to next target
		smooth pursuit
			special case movement without ballistic leap

		tracking smooth pursuit can be a selection technique
	
	perceptual organisition
		figure & ground
		person is figure, background is ground

		visual groups
		related objects

		visuospacial hierarchy
		regions
		visual groups
			gestalt rules
				proximity
				common area
				similarity
				continuation

	attention
		focus processing on an area

		selective attention
			move attention around
		vigilance
			sustained attention
		divided attention
			many at once

		change blindness
			harder to detect blindness during visual disruption
		inattention blindness
			failure to detect changes when attention is not directed there

	saliency
		which features are most likely to attract attention
	
	clutter
		when everything tries to be salient
	
		test:
			how hard is it to add something that stands out

Motor control
	regulation of movement

	use of motor control
		can modify GUI to match motor control of user
		dynamically adjust ui to aid motor control
		different keyboard layouts
	
	end effector
		something I can control eg eye, arm
	degrees of freedom
		how many ways we can move end effector in 3d space
	open loop - no feedback, fast
	closed loop - uses feedback so slow
	speed accuracy tradeoff
		higher speed inputs have lower accuracy

	fitts law
		movement time = MT = a + b * index of difficulty
		index of difficulty = ID = log( D/W + 1 )

		D is distance
		W is target width
	
		can be used to compare input devices
		throughput
			ID / MT
			or 1 / b

		also applies to crossing task
		different equation for tunnel steering task
			movement speed proportional to tunnel width

		crossing many targets of a certain width is the same as tunnel steering

	simple reaction
		reaction time = decision time + nondecision time = decision time + x + y
		x = perceptual diffusion
		y = motor response

	choice reaction
		may need to react to n triggers
		open loop
		time taken = bH
		H = entropy of decision

		if all are equally likely
		T = a + b log2 n

Cognition
	relavant capabilites
		control
		memory
		attention
		reasoning
		decision making

	sets goals and maintains focus
		goal is a desirable state
		memory not accurate, its useful

	limited
		spatially
		limited memory

	based on internal models
		bad model - can be tricked
		but can be used to eg metaphors
		internal model leveraged to enhance HCI

	cognition constantly adapting
	can requires effort
		task effort and state effort
		energy saving mechanism


technology is driven by needs
	social relationships
	purpose and direction
	novelty
	ability to perform well
	recognition
	security

	self determination theory
		needs are motivational
		self growth
		people actively seek new opportunities
	
		needs:
			autonomy
			competancy
			relatedness

		can be used to motivate users
		needs lead to actions, can provide offerings based on users actions, motivations and needs
	
collaboration
	everything is collaborative
	"a mutually beneficial relationship between two or
	more parties who work toward common goals by sharing
	responsibility, authority, and accountability for achieving results"

	cooperation
		division of labour
	
	axes:
		synchronous or asynchronous
		colocated or remote
	
	also depends on scale and community of practice
	nascence
	permanance
	turnover

	people form territories
		can be reflected in UIs

	articulation is just as important
	awareness too, knowing what others are doing
	and boundary objects like whiteboards that drive the activity

	shared understanding
	grounding to create shared knowledge
	theory of mind to infer how others are feeling
