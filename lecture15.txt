building any system is hard
interactive even harder
engineering methods tackle it efficiently

need to build the right thing
	need solution neutral problem statement
	understand requirements
	are validated and verified
	need to understand the whole system
	need to keep people sage
	can follow formal systematic approaches

systems are pervasive
	theyre everywhere
	even a doorhandle is a complex series of systems
	everywhere in our lives
	even we are a system

properties of systems
	anything can be a system
	to be interesting it has to have properties that matter and complexity
	they operate at multiple levels of abstraction
	they are often coupled and depend on other systems
	interesting systems have emergent properties
		more than the sum of its parts
	
interactive systems
	takes input from human and interacts with context then is processed and gives output

they are embedded in wider systems
	how can surgeons interact with systems and get info without touching anything
		touchless is only 1 thing
		also need to understand collaborative nature of surgery
		hard to implement without false positives of other motions
	need to understand the wider system too

systems approach
	comes from recognition that nontrivial problems require cross disciplinary and cross hierarchical thinking
	need to consider lots of interacting systems

	principles
		understand the purpose
			what are we trying to do and what does it mean
			cost performance timeline & risk
		think hollistically
			systems are bounded, figure out the boundary and only worry about what is inside
		systematic procedure
		be creative
			combine conventional and unconventional
		account for the people in the process
		manage the product and relationship

	skeptical
		lack of system approach can be traced to the failure of many projects

	system mapping
		create maps of the system
		create a system boundary
		to figure out what we care about
		boundary changes depending on concerns

		task diagram
			hierarchical
			nodes are tasks linked by processes

		information diagram
			documents are nodes and links are relationships

		org diagram
			tree hierarchy
			can help understand relationships between people and teams

		system diagram
			shows flow of data through the process
			and below a state diagram/flow chart
			shows data driven processes

		swimlane
			shows processes
			lanes are the different stakeholders
			flow shows processes and involvement of different stakeholders

		communication diagrams
			show who communicates with who
			shows flow of information

		can use the diagrams to map out a system and do design support
		shows us how to start designing

	prinicpals for legal and ethical systems
		illegal means prosecution
		unethical means you lose reputation
		ethical issues relate to norms, what is acceptable or not
		communities have ethics codes and professional conduct guidelines
		unethical usage of user data and experimentation

	prinicpals for AI systems
		privacy
		accountability
		safety and security
		transparency and explainability
		fairness and non discrimination
		human control opt out 
		professional responsibility
		promotion of human values

	is it actionable
		what do you do after mapping
		doesnt really tell you what to do
		how do you know youre aware of every part of the systems
		analysis paralysis
			consider so many things that you cant even make progress
	
	design engineering
		systematic approach
		5 challenges
			design fixation
			tradeoffs
			communication
			integration
			risk management

		identify process
		requirements
		conceptual design
		embodiment design and detailed design
		verification and validation

		identifying purpose
			need solution neutral problem statement
			remove requirements and constraints
			move quantatative statements to qualatative statements
			raise level of abstraction to increase search space and enable divergent thinking

		find the correct abstraction level
			needs professional judgement

		figure out requirements
			technical
			business
			regulatory
			user
		want a complete requirements specification
			each needs to be
				solution independent
				clear
				concise
				testable
				traceable

		conceptual design
			generate concepts
			based on functions
			what is a function
				a solution neutral description of what a system needs to do
			function carrier
				something that specifies how a system might carry out a function

		function modelling
			overall function with incoming inputs and outputs
			that cen be decomposed into lower level functions

		function analysis systems technique
			maps higher order functions and their lower level functions
			horizontal axis is abstraction
			vertical axis is time

		generating concepts
			list functions
			and map them to candidate solutions

			then evaluate the solutions
			score solutions on criteria and weight by importance

		verification
			
		safety and risk
			mistake
				wrong intention
			slip
				right intention but failed in execution

			both come from lack of knowledge

		skills, rules and knowledge
			skill based
				not much conscious control
			rule based
				based on stored/learned rules
			knowledge based
				have to think and plan

			signals
				low level control signals
			sign
				has to be recognised and acted on
			symbol
				has to be understood and reasoned about and a plan formed

			error comes from a failure in processing of one of these
	
		risk
			likelihood * impact
			comes from a hazard
			can design away many hazards

		risk management
			identify hazard
			estimate the risk
			evaluate the risk
			control the risk/mitigate
			monitor the risk
