Provide a definition for Class Diagram. Explain why a Class Diagram alone
is not sufficient to describe a system and identify another type of diagram that can be
useful. 
	
	A class diagram is a UML diagram which represents the key concepts in the system - the classes - along with their data and behaviours
	It also represents the relationships between them, in terms of inheritance, composition and ownership
	numeracy of relationships and nature thereof can also be represented

	a class diagram represents the relationships between classes but not the flow of data over time between them
	a sequence diagram can represent how methods are called on different classes over time


A large company specialising in bespoke software development has won a contract
to deliver a software tool for monitoring a particular parameter in the operation of a new
generation nuclear power plant.

	Describe the Team that is likely to be working on the project and clearly define their
	roles and responsibilities. 

		Project Manager
			oversees the project and ensures everything is being completed on time and on budget
			scheduling and rescheduling work
			and tracking progress

		Architect
			usually a subject expert
			designs the overall architecture of the system, the core classes and interfaces
			designs majot modules
			Specification and High level design

		Lead programmer
			leads programming team
			spends 30% of time supervising other programmers
			implenting complex features and solving problems

		programmers
			maybe 3-5
			implement features according to spec and write unit tests

		tester
			designs tests for the end-to-end system for functions that aren't easy to automate
			based on specification and focus on validating the overall product rather than induvidual modules


	Specify the Software Model that is likely to be employed for the development of the
	software. List the key stages in the development process and explain the advantages of
	this approach for this type of software.
	
		waterfall
			analysis and specification
			design
			implementation and integration
			testing
			deployment and maintenance / operations

		requirements can be known from the start
		important to spend a long time analysing and validating requirements because cost of mistakes is high
			will be very hard to make changes after deployment - recall may be needed
		works well with traditional project management tools like gantt charts and makes billing the customer easy
		allows comprehensive testing period allowing for regulatory certification
		>>>>> safety critical so has to work from the start!!!!!


	Discuss what could go wrong with the project and what sort of risks the company
	should be prepared to mitigate.

		the project could overrun or go over budget - risk of failure to deliver what was promised and delay the project or harm the business
		requirements could be missed or misinterpreted - risk that product will not be delivered in a working form and expensive changes/recall will be required
		the requirements may change - risk that time spent working on something will be wasted
		>>>>> users might use the system in unexpected ways!!!!!
		>>>>> performance in real-world conditions might be bad!!!!!
		>>>>> safety or security requirements might not be met!!!!!

	
	Describe the measures that the company could implement to reduce the likelihood
	of any potential crises in the project.

		overrunning - add extra time into the project or leave option to descope as required, make sure schedule and project management tools are employed correctly
		requirements wrong - go over them with experts and developers and make them 100% clear and correct, consider analysis methods like FMEA
		changes may be needed - maybe take a more iterative approach like spiral
		users might use the system in an unexpected way - perform usability tests with representative user groups
		performance might be bad - do scaling and performance tests in as close to real world conditions as possible
		safety or security might be bad - non functional validation testing
		>>>>> involve experts in designing test processes!!!!!

		integration testing
		validation testing
		performance testing
		stress and scaling testing
		security testing
		usability testing
		non functional testing
		

Provide a definition for Class and Object. Describe the relationship between them.
	
	A class is a key concept within a software system
	it has data and behaviour
	they provide abstraction and encapsulation, making it easier to modify and grow the software

	an object is an instantiation of a class
	two objects of the same class with the same data will behave identically


Explain what is meant by a Design Pattern in the context of Object Oriented
Design. Give one example of a Design Pattern.
	
	a design pattern is a standard architecture employed to solve a common problem in software design
	the design pattern can be represented in a standard fashion such as with UML and shared, then applied to similar problems by other developers
	for example, the observer pattern can be used to disseminate information to multiple different destinations in a simple way
		>>>>> multiple different objects maintain a consistent view on the state of the object of interest!!!!!


Give two examples of Agile methodologies, and compare and contrast them
with more traditional software development models. 

	agile methodologies:
		extreme programming
		test driven development
		feature driven development
		agile modelling
		agile unified process
		dynamic system development
		scrum!!

	fast iterations (week) vs slow development cycle (months)
	automated testing vs testing phase at the end
	automated build vs manual build
	user stories evolving vs spec fixed from start
	>>>>> harder to charge customers and use traditional project management tools!!!!!	
	>>>>> not suitable for safety critical systems!!!!!


A company is working on the development of software for monitoring of zebrafish
in research laboratory settings. The results are used to investigate the genetic cause of
human diseases, and identify and test new drugs to treat the diseases being modelled.

	Suggest a specific software development model suitable for this project.
	Discuss considerations to be taken into account in making this decision and explain
	the reasons for your choice.
		
		waterfall is suitable because the requirements can be known from the start of the project and are unlikely to change
		on top of this, the application is safety critical and must work from the start
			otherwise medical outcomes may be less positive
		stringent regulation is likely to apply for which comprehensive documentation and extensive testing will be required
			the testing phase of waterfall allows for this
		the cost of changes may be very high, involving recalling machines etc
			so the requirements must be well understood from the start, suggesting a thorough analysis and specification process as in waterfall would be beneficial
		agile methods can be used after core development for non safety-critical features
	

	Describe the software development process for the proposed model and give
	examples of the tools that can be used to manage the development process. 
		
		waterfall process:
			analysis and specification
				investigate the system and wider systems to interface with and understand what is required
				formalise the requirements in a specification and validate the specification with stakeholders
				>>>>> and documentation in accordance with relevant regulations is produced!!!!!
			design
				plan out the architecture and interfaces of the system
				>>>>> design is documented!!!!!
			implementation and integration
				implement the code for the system and integrate the different modules into a cohesive whole
			testing
				ensure all functions of the system are correct and that it meets the specification
				>>>>> test processes are designed!!!!!
				>>>>> test in real life environment or as close as possible!!!!!
			deployment and maintenance
				onboard users to the system and provide support for any issues, releasing bugfixes in case of problems

		tools:
			gantt charts for project management and schduling
			quality management framework for testing
			source code management system can be used for development

	
	Identify what potentially could go wrong if your suggested software
	development model is employed. Describe the measures that the company could
	implement to reduce the likelihood of any potential issues.

		requirements may be missed - if changes have to be made after deployment the cost will be very high
			- consult with experts and make sure analysis and specification is comprehensive
			- can also use more iterative approach / protyping like spiral to reduce cost of missed requirements
		performance may not be good in real world conditions - perform scaling and stress testing
		security may be lacking - system may be comporomised - non functional validation tests
		users may use the system in unexpected ways - people may not get good use from the system - usability testing
		>>>>> not completed on time / on budget - use project management tools!!!!!
		>>>>> requirements are misinterpreted - make sure requirements are clear and design test processes with experts!!!!!


In object oriented design, explain the difference between an interface and an
abstract class.

	An interface is an abstract class that declares/defines no data
		defines only behaviour


In object oriented design, explain what is meant by decoupling.

	Decoupling is a quality of a system that means it is easy to modify and extend one part/module/class without interfering with and needing to be concerned about
	the effect on other parts of the system
	it can be acheived using abstraction and encapsulation


In software engineering, discuss advantages and disadvantages of continuous
integration practices.

	continuous integration means that changes made to the software are automatically tested using the automated test suite
		helps to catch bugs early - following test early & test often advice to keep cost of testing and bugs low
		bugs are caught early and can be fixed before they cause more problems
	however the maintenance overhead of running the test pipeline and writing unit tests may not be worth it, especially for small projects
		developers don't like writing tests
	>>>>> automated build is neccessary - can save time but need to set up!!!!!
	>>>>> single source repo - avoid complex manual merging!!!!!


A company is working on an independent news website that uses a novel approach
to publish a diversity of opinion on matters concerning public life and democracy.

	Suggest the software development methodology that would be most suitable
	for the development of the public news website. Describe this software development
	methodology and explain how it can be used in the project.

		requirements are not known from the start - how users will interact with and on the site is unclear
		would also like to be able to quickly integrate changes and get feedback from users
		so use agile approach eg scrum
		iterative process, releasing new versions continuously through CI/CD and doing week long sprints based on user stories
			user stories keep focus on user, allow specification for software to evolve and integrate user feedback
		>>>>> need to reduce cost of change, since what is right today is not what is right tomorrow!!!!!
		>>>>> ten minute builds, automated testing!!!!!


	Design a testing strategy for the website. Identify the key test areas that
	would allow the company to address the main risks in the project, and specify the
	appropriate tests to mitigate these risks.

		risk that users may not be able to use/will use the site in unexpected ways
			usability testing with representative user groups
		risk that the site will not perform under load/in real world conditions
			performance, stress and scaling tests in as close to real world conditions as possible
		there may be security problems with the site
			non-functional acceptance testing, pentesting
		logic on the site/UI components will break
			automated unit tests
		the site will not serve the purposes that the users need it for
			validation & verification testing
		

	Describe the deployment pipeline that might be suitable for the public news
	website project, its main stages, the tools that might be used and the benefits of
	following the proposed approach.

		step 0 is code linting and static type checking
			quick checks to make sure code is valid before building
		first step is building - must be automated and less than 10 mins
			Make / Jenkins
			output is build artefacts
		artefacts are run through automated test pipeline
			>>>>> regression tests!!!!!
			>>>>> longer running acceptance tests!!!!!
			Jenkins / TravisCI / CircleCI
		then validated artefacts are brought to staging environment where they can be run in close to real world conditions by testers
			release candidates can be easily viewed and classified
		then deployment might be handled by jenkins again, pushing new versions to servers

		benefits:
			reduce overhead of manually building and testing versions, saving developers time and therefore money
			can quickly release fixes or new features to stay competetive
			>>>>> get feedback from users on features quickly!!!!!

	
In software engineering, discuss the differences between a composite design
pattern and a decorator design pattern.
	
	The composite pattern allows a group of objects to be treated (have the same interface as) a single object
	The decorator pattern allows an object to gain additional fucntionality while maintaining the same interface


A company is developing control software for an automated car braking system.

	Specify the software development methodology that would be most suitable.
	Discuss considerations to be taken into account in making this decision and explain
	the reasons for your choice. 

		safety critical system so use waterfall
		>>>>> has to work perfectly from the very start!!!!!
		waterfall allows specification to be well-defined from the start and robust documentation to be produced throughout the process
			which is vital for safety and regulatory certification
		if anything is missed or there are bugs the cost of recalling cars would be huge
			so waterfall is good because it allows comprehensive analysis for the specification before implementation
			and thorough testing phase
		waterfall also makes it easier to charge customers and works well with traditional project management tools

	
	Describe the software development process for the proposed model and give
	examples of the tools that can be used to manage the development process.

		waterfall phases:
			analysis and specification
				investigate the system and the environment it will be used in, the users and other systems it must interface with
				as well as any relevant regulation, making documentation as neccessary
				define exactly what functions the software needs to have
			design
				decide on the architecture of the system, the high level design and core modules and interfaces between them
				create design documentation
			implementation and integration
				write the code for the system and produce unit tests, integrate the different modules in the system
			testing
				comprehensively test the system in accordance with regulation and document the process
				make any changes needed
			deployment and maintenance
				onboard users to the system and provide support, releasing bugfixes if needed and updates

		tools:
			gantt chart for project management
			source code repo
			quality management system


	The latest model of the car will have a network connection with all software
	updates and patches being delivered wirelessly. Discuss how this is likely to affect
	your development process, and the implications it will have for the project costs. 

		ota updates mean that any errors in the system can be corrected by updates
			so cost of errors is reduced, recalls arent needed
			but if some cars lose connection and miss the update there could still be safety concerns
		maintenance of the ota system will increase costs
			management of many different versions deployed at different times and on different vehicles will be complex and costly
		can take a more iterative approach since CD is possible
			but not really because safety is still very important
		>>>>> security of the ota system will need to be 100% and will be expensive!!!!!	


Five basic perceptual tasks: discrimination, detection, recognition, estimation, and search:

	Discrimination: distinguishing a difference in sensory stimulation
	Detection: telling whether an event of interest occurs in the environment
	Recognition: categorising a stimulus
	Estimation: estimation a property of an object or event in the environment
	Search: locating an object of interest


Consider the design of a display that reveals the speed of a car to a driver. What are the positive
and negative qualities of using vision, hearing, and tactition as a display in this case?

	vision: very fast and high-bandwidth, parallel, detailed but may distract attention from the road
	hearing: serial, slower and lower bandwidth, may distract from conversation in the car and get annoying
		>>>>> might be hard to notice if its noisy!!!!!
	tactition: fast, would not distract as much but also serial and less sensitive/accurate, also requires physical contact


Fitts' Law
	MT = a + b log_2 (D/W + 1)


Hick-Hyman Law
	open loop decision time:

	T = bH = b sum_{i=1}^{n} ( p_i log_2 (1/p_i) )
	H is the entropy of the decision

	if they are all equally likely, Hick-Hyman applies:

	T = a + b log_2 n
	n is number of choices


A simple mobile device is operated by holding the device in the non-dominant hand and a plastic
pen in the dominant hand. The device enables text entry through a graphical keyboard presented on
a resistive screen. The system does not perform word prediction or auto-correct.

	A designer proposes to improve text entry performance by changing the colors on the keys on the
	graphical keyboard. From first principles, explain why this approach is fundamentally flawed.
		
		changing the colours will help experienced users quickly distinguish and localise each key
		however, the bottleneck in this scenario is not recognition, it is the motor control task of moving the pen between the keys
		this task is not made much easier by changing the colours of the targets
		>>>>> Fitts' Law applies, which is not dependent on visual saliency of targets!!!!!

	
	An alternative approach is to optimize the keyboard layout so that keys on the keyboard that are
	more likely to be hit in succession are close together. Assume there is a statistical letter-based bigram
	model that provides the the conditional probability of a letter key kj following a letter key ki. Using
	this model and knowledge about human motor control, propose an objective function for this design
	problem.

		objective function: sum of Fitts' Law evalulated over all keypairs' distances weighted by bigram frequency
		\sum_{i=0}^{26} \sum_{j=0}^{26} p_{ij} ( a + b \log_2 (D_{ij}/W + 1) )


	The optimization landscape rendered by the objective function in (b) results in a valley with many
	possible designs that have similar performance. Propose an additional design objective that would be
	particularly useful for this design problem. Briefly motivate your answer.

		The above expression will apply for users who have learned the location of all the keys, but to help new users we should try to make the locations
		of the keys easy to learn
		Can do this by assigning a larger objective function to layouts that are more similar to QWERTY, or layouts that organise the keys in roughly alphabetical order


A design team is creating a collaborative information visualization interface for a team of
2–3 analysts. The visual display measures 4 × 4 m and is mounted on a wall. The positions of the
individual users is tracked using an array of depth cameras mounted on top of the visual display so
that the system knows the position of each user—both in relation to the other users and in relation to
the display. The information visualization changes depending on the distance between an analyst and
the display: the closer an analyst is to the display, the more detailed information is provided. If two
analysts stand close together they experience the same information visualization in front of them. If
two analysts stand further apart the display will split and show them different visualizations that will
change individually depending on their respective distances to the display.

	Indicate where this system is situated in the two-axis model of collaborative technology.

		Colocated and Synchronous

	
	Explain how this system fits within the reality-based interaction framework.

		exploits people's awareness and control of their social surroundings and proximity to the board and other people
		proximity based interaction through the system
		and the fact that users can speak and interact during use

	
	Explain what the difference is between collaboration and cooperation.

		Cooperation is working on a task by splitting it up into parts which can be handled by different people
			>>>>> some division of labour is in place!!!!!
		Collaboration indicates the existence of shared goals, knowledge and ways of working, in addition to cooperation

	
	A team of three analysts are to use this system to collaboratively gain insight into a complex
	dataset. Discuss how how this system may support or impact coordination.

		will allow people to view the dataset at different levels of abstraction?????
		>>>>> awareness!!!!!
			will allow members of the team visibility into what the others are looking at
			allows people to work together just by walking closer to each other
			allows communication by speaking
		>>>>> boundary objects!!!!!
			>>>>> the board is a boundary object!!!!!
		>>>>> articulation work!!!!!
			>>>>> determining how to carry out work - may be helped by system reactivity or harmed by need to coordinate positioning!!!!!


A company is designing a smartphone app that uses the smartphone’s sensors to automatically
detect when the driver is searching for an available parking spot. When such an activity is detected
the system connects to an online service and proposes an available parking spot to the driver.

	State the system boundary of this service. Briefly motivate your choice of boundary.
			
		includes phone, internet connection, car, user, car park
		app needs to understand state of user and car to know when and how to alert
		needs to include phone and internet connection as it depends on these to run
		needs to know about car park to know what alert to give
		>>>>> any applicable legislation!!!!!


	State the type and level of automation of this service.

		presents one alternative action to user that can be ignored or dismissed = level 4
		decision automation - automates the action of deciding on a space


	Suggest two user-centric primary evaluation criteria that would be the most critical when assessing
	this automation task. Briefly motivate your answer.

		Minimising cost of incorrectness - could waste user's time if the suggested spot isnt empty????? no thats system centric
		Considering the user's attention - don't distract them while driving
		>>>>> mental workload - should only help find a spot not add extra mental strain to the process!!!!!


	Critique this service by drawing from three relevant principles for mixed-initiative interfaces.

		learn from experiences - maybe
		Easy to dismiss - otherwise it would annoy the user
		>>>>> provide significant added value!!!!!
		>>>>> Minimising cost of incorrectness - could waste user's time if the suggested spot isnt empty!!!!!
		>>>>> balance user's attention and timing of the service!!!!!
		

	Suggest a suitable risk assessment method for this service and explain how this risk assessment
	would be carried out.

		hopefully a low risk service if implemented correctly so can use SWIFT
		ask if this happens, what will be the outcome
			with a group of different people for as many ideas as possible
			when risks are identified decide whether they need mitigation and if so create some next steps to be followed
		>>>>> table of prompts, their hazards and risks, mitigations and a ranking!!!!!


A central task in children’s eduction is learning multiplication tables. To support this, a
design team has created a tablet app that challenges children in class to quickly carry out a series ten
multiplications. Depending on the time and accuracy the child receives points which the child can use
to buy equipment and clothing for a virtual rock band. This virtual rock band can be shared with
other children in the class. The app is administered by the child’s teacher and both the teacher and
the child’s parents can observe progress.
	
	Explain how the human needs that are important according to self-determination theory support
	this design.

		sdt says people want
		to grow and improve
			design helps students improve their skills and see their progress reflected in their band
		to be self-directed
			allows students to express themselves through the choice of things for their band
		to feel togetherness
			students are able to share their progress with their friends in the class
		>>>>> competency, autonomy and relatedness!!!!!

	In the event the child inputs an incorrect answer, explain the difference between a mistake and a
	slip. Briefly describe what a mistake or a slip may tell us about the child’s learning.
		
		a mistake is where the intention was wrong but the execution was correct
			indicates that more learning is needed
		a slip is where the intention was correct but the execution was wrong
			doesn't tell anything about the child's progress


	Explain if a child is exhibiting skill-, rule-, or knowledge-based behavior when using the app to
	answer multiplication questions.

		initially knowledge based, since the child must interpret the UI, question and figure out how to answer it (form a goal)
			then figure out how to input the answer and evaluate their success
		then rule based as the child knows the flow and applies rules to figure out the answers to the multiplications
		then skill based as the answers become memorised

	
	Propose a strategy for managing the risks inherent in this system.

		SWIFT evaluated on eg. a quarterly basis
		need to have a way to identify risks, mitigate and track them
		>>>>> risk management strategy has 5 steps!!!!!
			>>>>> identify hazards, estimate risks, evaluate risk, reduce risks to acceptability, monitor risks!!!!!
		>>>>> need system boundary!!!!!
		>>>>> HAZOP and risk matrix!!!!!


A design team is tasked with creating a user interface and workflow for a new purchasing system
for a firm making embedded devices with 8,000 employees distributed in the UK, USA and Australia.
The firm has a highly unusual set of requirements and work practices for managing purchasing due to
working in a niche area heavily restricted by regulation and international law. The purchasing system
is to be used by engineers, engineering managers, and quality assurance testers distributed in the UK,
USA and Australia.

	Propose principles for formulating a research strategy for carrying out user research with the
	stakeholders. Motivate these principles with reference to the purchasing system.

		>>>>> no fully accurate method of user research!!!!!
			>>>>> so selection of methods needs to follow from the goals!!!!!
		>>>>> goals need to be clarified!!!!!
		>>>>> balance realism, precision and generalisability!!!!!
		>>>>> realism: how well can we model how the system will actually be used!!!!!
		>>>>> precision: how much detailed, accurate info can we collect!!!!!
		>>>>> generalisability: how well will user research apply to real usage by the real user group!!!!!
		>>>>> triangulate by combining many methods to make up from weaknesses in different methods!!!!!

	
	The design team decides to carry out the user research by first distributing a survey to all the
	end-users. The survey results will then be analyzed and subsequently used as a basis for contextual
	inquiry, which will be carried out in the UK due to the design team being based there. Discuss possible
	issues with the methodological quality of this research strategy.
		
		survey will suffer from say do problem
		and will be skewed by many biases including responder bias
		will not be able to expose tacit knowledge
		UK user group may not generalise well
		>>>>> no triangulation!!!!!


	Explain how the principles of contextual inquiry could be used to gain insight into users’ needs and
	wants based on their interactions with the existing purchasing system.
		
		microphenomenological interviews - capture the user in the act of doing something maybe unexpected and ask them about it
		should be in as realistic a setting as possible
		minimise effect of observation
		>>>>> context: users actually using the system in their work!!!!!
		>>>>> partnership: form a relationship with the users so that they explain their experiences!!!!!
		>>>>> interpretation: involve the user in finding meaning in the data collected so design team can work with it!!!!!
		>>>>> focus: interview should be deep and capture all nuances!!!!!


	Describe what the say/do problem is. Would the say/do problem apply to the contextual inquiry
	planned by the design team here? Explain your reasoning.

		the say do problem is the fact that what people say they do is not what they do,
		because what they do is driven in part by subconscious tacit knowledge which cannot be communicated
		contextual enquiry is not as sensitive to this as eg a survey because it observes what users do rather than relying on what they say
		>>>>> and interviewer and user work together to derive meaning so users arent speculating!!!!!


A large international consultancy firm is introducing a new communication tool to stimulate
more collaboration between local and remote team members engaged in consulting. The tool enables
secure messaging and sharing of documents and spreadsheets, including valuable client data.

	Describe the difference between personalization and tailoring.
		
		personalisation is about adaptation of nonfuntional behaviour
		tailoring is about changing the function of the system to a user's preferences

	
	Explain why, despite the system initially fulfilling the users’ needs and wants, users are still likely
	to engage in appropriation.

		the users' needs will change over time so different ways of engaging with the system will emerge for the new needs
		>>>>> and full understanding of users' needs is unlikely from the start!!!!!

	
	Suggest three appropriation moves that might occur with this system and explain how guidelines
	for appropriation can mitigate or enhance, as appropriate, such effects.

		>>>>> slow uptake!!!!!
		>>>>> use of a different system due to percieved deficiencies of the system!!!!!
		>>>>> substitution of parts of the system for other systems!!!!!

		>>>>> expose intentions of the system, visibility provides trust!!!!!
		>>>>> support rather than control users, give flexibility!!!!!


A device is designed to allow users to control the relative humidity in their house. The device
has two modes. In Automatic mode the system controls the level of relative humidity such that it is
within an interval of 50-60%. In Manual mode the user can set a specific desired level of relatively
humidity and the system will attempt to maintain this level. The device is a small wall-mounted unit
with the following user interface elements: (1) a visual display indicating the current level of relative
humidity and whether the system is in Automatic mode or Manual mode; (2) ‘-’ and ‘+’ buttons
that enable the user to reduce or increase their desired level of relatively humidity respectively; (3)
an ‘Automatic’ button that puts the system into Automatic mode. If the user pushes the ‘-’ or
‘+’ button the system switches to Manual mode and will remain there until the user pushes the
‘Automatic’ button.

	Draw a state diagram for this system.

		,_,						  ,_+-_,
		| v						  |    v
		auto --- press + or - --> manual
		  ^                         |
		  '----- press auto --------'
	

	By viewing interaction with this system as goal-directed action, explain the steps comprising the
	gulf-of-evaluation and the gulf-of-execution for this user interface.

		gulf of evaluation: the user needs to figure out what state the device is in and what state they would like it to be in, and how these states relate
		to the humidity in the room. There is also a long delay between the device state changing and the room humidity changing

		gulf of execution: the user needs to input the right sequence of button presses to get the device into the state they would like it to be in
		>>>>> harder because the interface displays not the target value but the current value!!!!!


	State the type type and level of automation for this system.

		action automation - sensing and adjusting the humidity level
		very low level automation because it just keeps the humidity at 1 level and only if the user sets it to
		>>>>> offers a complete set of actions: level 2!!!!!


	Is this system a mixed-initiative interface? Briefly motivate your answer.
		
		not really because the interface does not collaborate with the user, it is set by the user
		>>>>> system does not take any initiative (to commence automation)!!!!!


	Analyze this system based on the following five cognitive dimensions of notation: (1) viscosity; (2)
	visibility; (3) premature commitment; (4) hidden dependencies; and (5) role-expressiveness.

		viscosity of the interface is low because it can be controlled easily by a few button presses, but viscosity of the overall system including humidity of the
		room is high because it changes very slowly
		visibility: not very good because the target humidity is not displayed?????
		>>>>> visibility is good since all actions available to the user are visible!!!!!
		premature commitment: ok, you can easily switch in and out of any modes
		hidden dependancies: target is hidden and depends on button presses
		role expressiveness: ok since the interface displays if it is in manual or auto
		>>>>> role of buttons is clear since they have markings on which represent their function!!!!!


A software agent is incorporated into a spreadsheet application. The agent observes the user’s
work in the spreadsheet and automatically detects when data is suitable to visualized. At such a point
the agent proposes the most suitable visualization method for the data. The user can also tell the
agent to propose a visualization at any point by clicking on an icon representing the agent. If the
visualization is not suitable, the user can ask the agent to generate more suggestions, or simply show
a gallery of all possibilities. Based on such interaction the agent learns the user’s preferences.

	State the type and level of automation of this service.

		>>>>> action automation and level 5 - automatically executes the action if the user approves!!!!!

	
	Using the user-centric and system-centrical evaluation criteria from the types and levels of automa-
	tion framework, suggest three potential design issues with this system. Briefly motivate each design
	issue.

		>>>>> mental workload & automation reliability & cost of action outcomes - assistant may bother the user when they are focused and distract them!!!!!


	Explain whether the system as stated is adhering to the principles for mixed-initiative interfaces.

		yes, value is added since the user may be able to present a good visualisation they wouldnt have otherwise
		can be easily dismissed
		and the user can prompt the system if it does not take the initiative itself
		>>>>> and learns from prior interactions!!!!!
		>>>>> and makes suggestions when suitable, balancing cost of interruption with value of suggestion!!!!!


Identify Extreme Programming practices that would be not suitable for a project
designing software used for medical diagnostics of illnesses in patients.

	user stories instead of spec - not fixed or known at the start
	continuous deployment - bug could cause misdiagnosis
	shared source code repo - some code may need to be protected
	no set test phase

A new technology startup is developing a social photo sharing application. The
application allows mobile phone users to capture images from the camera, or select
existing images and “publish” them in their photo stream (optionally applying some
image effects before submitting images). Users can “follow” photo streams of other
users. In addition to the mobile app, users can access their account online via a
website. Design a test plan for the project, specifying types of tests, including their
purpose and examples.

	users may find it difficult/unintuitive to use the app or site or may want to use it in unexpected ways
		run usability studies with representative user groups
	the UI flow of the app or site or the underlying logic may break due to a bug
		developers should write unit tests alongside their code which will run automatically to catch bugs
		for the tests that can't be automated, QA testers should have end-to-end validation and verification testing procedures
		>>>>> and integration tests to ensure modules interface correctly!!!!!
	the performance of the app may not be acceptable in real-world use
		run performance, load and stress tests in as close to real-world conditions as possible
	security of the app and site may be insufficient
		non-functional acceptance tests
	regression tests too


A company developing mobile apps submitted an app for publishing in a leading app
store. The application was rejected due to the Support URL being unreachable when
evaluated in the app store review process. This mistake resulted in a two week delay
in publishing the application.

The development team started to use Five Whys technique to analyse the problem
as follows:

i. Why was the submission rejected? The support URL was unreachable.

ii. Why the URL was unreachable? The development team did not setup the
URL on the server.

iii. Why did not the team setup URL? Preparing the release in a rush they
specified the correct URL in the submission form but forgot to set it up on the server.

iv. Why was not this mistake spotted by in testing? The app submission is a
manual process and there are no tests to check the correctness of the submission form
data.

v. Why was the submission process manual? The company has only published
two application and it was quick for a single person manage both submission.

Using the Five Whys technique analyse the cause of the problem and suggest a
proportional corrective action at every level of the analysis.

	support url was unreachable
		>>>>> setup the url!!!!!
		make sure support urls are reachable before submitting apps
	did not setup url
		automate process of setting up support urls
	forgot to set it up
		add automatic tests before a form is submitted
	no tests to check, manual process
		automate this process, invest time now to save time later
	quick for 1 person to oversee process
		rethink approach to important submissions, work as a team to make errors less likely


Consider an input device for a medical device that must ensure users are making very accurate
inputs. Input needs range from providing numbers and text to controlling a cursor on a screen. Which
input devices would be suitable for which types of input? Is the choice of input device sufficient to
ensure high reliability? If not, what other elements of the user interface would need to be considered?

	>>>>> certain input is needed!!!!!
	input devices that are large, easy to use and tactile
	mouse may be shaky, joystick might be better
	keyboard for text input
	also need workflows and UI to emphasise accuracy and correctness, and allow mistakes to be avoided or undone easily

A problem when using auto-correct on a smartphone keyboard is that the system may inadver-
tently correct text that should not be corrected. This problem has been colloquially described as the
‘auto-correct trap’. A smartphone keyboard redesign attempts to alleviate this problem by allowing
users to press harder on keys the user does not want the auto-correct algorithm to change. The harder
the key press, the less likely the auto-correct algorithm changes that key press into a different letter.

	Is this system open-loop or closed-loop interaction, or a combination of both? Briefly motivate
	your answer.

		open loop because there is no feedback - the feedback only comes after the long press is released and the autocorrect either does or doesnt act?????
		>>>>> closed loop because long / hard press is based on tactile feedback!!!!!

	
	A key assumption behind this system is that users are able to tell beforehand whether the auto-
	correct algorithm is likely to auto-correct their input into the intended text or not. Suggest a suitable
	research method for validating this assumption among a large body of smartphone keyboard users.
	Briefly motivate your answer.

		can use a survey
		may not be easy to find representative group - different users will use different vocabulary and will not be able to capture all of it in the survey
		say do problem should be minimal because the survey is not on user's actions but just their understanding of autocorrect which is not tacit knowledge
		>>>>> could reach a large body of users!!!!!


	The system is implemented and evaluated in an experiment. Users are provided sentences from
	a corpus that they are asked to type as quickly and as accurately as possible. The independent
	variable is CorrectionMethod with two levels: {Auto-Correct, Pressure-Sensitive-Auto-Correct}.
	The dependent variables are entry and error rate. Explain why a within-subjects design is both
	practical and suitable.

		asymmetric skill transfer will be minimal since the tasks are distinct
		variance of users will be cancelled out by exposure to both correction methods
		>>>>> keeps number of users smaller!!!!!


	Discuss internal and external validity threats to the experiment sketched in (c).

		internal validity:
			high as long as a mix of words that would be correctly and incorrectly corrected is used
		
		external validity:
			user group from the study may not generalise to the wider user population
			lab environment may not be representative of real world
			sentences used in the trial may not be representative of real world language
			>>>>> is copying prewritten sentences representative of composing a text as in real usage!!!!!


A drawing application runs on a tablet operated with a pen. The design team wants to implement
a graphical menu structure that allows users access to all commands in the software.
	
	Explain the difference between closed-loop and open-loop control, including the advantages and
	disadvantages for each form of interaction.

		closed loop control:
			slower, more precise, involves feedback
		open loop control:
			faster, less precise, no feedback because it's a memorised motion


	Describe the difference between a pie menu and a marking menu.

		a marking menu only displays a visual menu after a timeout, before which time a gesture can be drawn to navigate the menu rapidly

	
	Explain when interaction with a marking menu is closed-loop and open-loop.

		when the user is first using the menu, interaction is closed loop because the user is navigating the menu based on visual feedback
		over time the motions to nagivate to each option become memorised
		the motion can then be exectuted as a closed loop interaction

	
	The design team is considering a choice between a hierarchical linear pull-down menu and a marking
	menu. Describe the primary advantages and disadvantages in using either approach.

		pulldown menu is slower and always open loop so can't be as fast for experienced users
		but more familiar for most users
		>>>>> dropdown menus can have more options per level!!!!!
		>>>>> marking menus have continuous transition from closed to open loop interaction!!!!!
		also dropdown menu is not good for pen input device


	There are two ways to implement the hierarchical linear pull-down menu. In the first implementa-
	tion, as soon as the pen tip leaves a submenu, the submenu disappears. In the other implementation
	the submenu only disappears if the pen tip enters the previous menu. Explain whether these imple-
	mentations rely on crossing or steering actions.

		first option is steering because user has to keep pointer in a small channel
			higher index of difficulty
		second is crossing, lower index of difficulty


A smartphone app enables a user to achieve a task through two alternative methods. In the first
method, the user must push a button on the screen, navigate to a menu with five choices, and choose
the fifth choice. This brings up a Yes/No confirmation dialog box. The user must answer Yes.

In the second method, the user must hold a physical button down for one second until the system plays
a brief audio beep and then speak a command. This results in the system playing a different audio
beep to indicate it has commenced speech recognition, and yet another different audio beep to indicate
speech recognition has concluded. Assuming speech recognition successfully recognized the command,
at this point the system uses audio to ask the user for a confirmation. The user has to again hold a
physical button down for one second until the system plays a brief audio beep and then speak “Yes”.

	Carry out a KLM-GOMS analysis to understand the time durations required to carry out the
	task using both methods. Propose any operators necessary and estimate their time durations. Briefly
	motivate the operators, their estimated time durations, and the operator sequences involved.

		operators:
			push a button: 0.3 s
			navigate a menu of N choices: 0.2N s
			
			recognise a beep: 0.5 s
			speak a command: 1 s
			listen to audio from computer: 1 s

		first:
			0.3 + 0.2*5 + 0.2*2 + 0.3 = 2 s
		second:
			1 + 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 1 = 6.5 s
	
		>>>>> PB + NM(5) + NM(2) + PB = 2!!!!!


	Explain the limitations of the KLM-GOMS analysis carried out in (a) with reference to the following
	design issues: (1) novice versus expert performance; (2) the uncertainties inherent in interaction when
	attempting to carry out the task using the two methods.

		The above analysis assumes expert level mistake-free performance. If for example the buttons are named very confusingly mistakes may be common
		meaning that average time taken would be much greater, especially for novice users
		>>>>> learning effects and walk up behaviour are not modelled!!!!!
		>>>>> uncertainties ie whether a speech command was reo=cognised successfully are not modelled!!!!!

	
	There is a risk an undesired event occurs when the user attempts to carry out the task. This
	happen when upon confirmation the user indicates No. Draw a fault tree to understand the possible
	causes of such an event.
		
		No
		and or
			press no button
				wrong user intent
				slip
			speak no
				wrong user intent
				slip


A design team is is creating a helmet that enables rapid triage for people in the vicinity of
blast explosions in a war zone. The idea is that the helmet has sensors that can sense the risk of brain
injury due to an explosion and communicate this information using a visual display.

	Derive a solution-neutral problem statement for this problem.

		Design a head-mounted system for users in a battlefield that senses risk of brain injury and alerts the user and medical teams if there is a risk
	

	Suggest a suitable sensor for the helmet.

		pressure sensor

	
	Propose a system boundary. Briefly motivate your choice of boundary.

		user, helmet and system itself, power supply, network connection, battlefield environment, medical response, military organisational structure, explosion
		system spans from the user near the explosion to the medical response - all intermediate systems must be considered


	Draw a function structure diagram for the key functions in this design.

The book Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City (2017, Crown), reports on a
longitudinal fieldwork study that followed eight low-income families in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.
A central conclusion is that low-income families are evicted as they spend too much of their income
paying rent, approximately 70% instead of the recommended limit of 30% of income. This results
in a lack of financial resilience causing an unexpected setback to result in a failure to pay rent and
subsequent eviction. At the same time, such families face very limited rental options, forcing them to
rent low-quality expensive accommodation.

	Explain why homelessness is considered a wicked design problem.
		
		there problem is very ill defined and is too wide in scope without a design space or constraints
		making progress is almost impossible
		>>>>> not possible to goal-refine to a well defined design task!!!!!


	One finding is that low-income families frequently move and, as a result, they fail to receive notices
	from the government that are posted by mail to their previous home address. Failing to adhere to
	these notices results in cuts to benefits, causing evictions. Use goal refinement to evolve a well-defined
	design task for this problem.

		devise a means to reliably communicate messages from the government to low-income families
		objective:
			95% of messages are received
		constraints:
			must be usable by all families
			must enable government to know if message was recieved
			>>>>> no stable home address!!!!!


	Another finding is that the landlords renting out accommodation to low-income families profit from
	renting out large quantities of low-quality accommodation to low-income families with little choice. In
	particular, working single mothers with small children requiring expensive daycare are vulnerable as
	the fathers tend not pay alimony and the benefits system is slow and bureaucratic with many rules
	that make it easy to experience a sudden cut to benefits, resulting in eviction. Draw rich picture about
	this design context.


	The study relies on fieldwork. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages in using the fieldwork
	method for researching issues with homelessness identified here.
		
		biases can be avoided as real world situations are directly observed
		need to build rapport
		need to make sure observation does not affect conclusions
		>>>>> contextualised and actual findings!!!!!
		>>>>> may be hard to generalise specific situations!!!!!
		>>>>> time consuming and costly!!!!!


	Suggest a user research method for validating the findings in the study discussed here. Briefly
	motivate your choice of follow-up research method.

		>>>>> surveys can reach many people but will suffer from eg non responder bias!!!!!
		>>>>> interviews help triangulate findings!!!!!
		>>>>> unobtrusive research eg historical records and stats!!!!!

	
The book Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies (1984, Basic Books) reports
on a series of sociological analyses of accidents in tightly coupled systems with high complexities. The
central thesis in the book is that accidents are normal in the sense that accidents are inevitable in
highly coupled complex systems, in particular if they have catastrophic potential. This does not mean
normal accidents are frequent: just as a human is expected to die at some point, a normal accident is
considered a normal, albeit infrequent, event.

	Explain why a tightly coupled complex system cannot be risk-free.

		risk is pervasive and every situation has a small risk
		any system that involves many interfacing situations will have risks
		>>>>> the only way to be risk free is to do nothing!!!!!

	
	Consider the user interface design of a nuclear power plant. To avoid accidents, the user interface
	will incorporate redundancy in the form of an automated system that checks that the operators have
	followed the correct protocol and taken correct actions given sensor readings indicated through the user
	interface. If the automated system detects that the protocol is not followed, the automated system
	seizes control and proceeds to follow the protocol. What is the type and level of automation in this
	system?

		level 6 - system acts only if the user does not act in time
		action automation


	It is discovered that it is possible that a sensor fault leads to the automated system in (b) to
	incorrectly seize control and apply an incorrect protocol. The system is subsequently modified to
	merely alert operators of an incorrect action and suggest corrective steps to ensure the appropriate
	protocol is followed. Suggest three principles from mixed-initiative interfaces that are particularly
	important for this task and explain how they apply to this particular design problem.

		need to minimise cost of incorrect guesses - would be high if system intervened and caused an accident
		need to consider user attention - dont distract the operators when they are doing important focused work
		>>>>> need to allow users a way to terminate the interaction easily - alert should be easy to turn off!!!!!


	Two operators are tasked with monitoring the nuclear power plant. One operator is incapacitated
	due to tripping over a raised threshold and burning themselves with hot coffee in the process. The
	second operator is busy calling for medical assistance. At this time, the automated system has detected
	a deviating sensor reading indicating a reactor fault. However, as it so happens, this sensor reading
	is due to faulty sensor and not due to any actual reactor fault. Nonetheless, since the operators are
	both either incapacitated or busy, they do not take the actions the protocol dictates for this particular
	sensor reading. As a result, the automated system issues an alert. As a fail-safe, if the alert is not
	attending to by either of the two operators, the alert is propagated to a third operator situated in
	a different location with no possibility to assess whether the sensor reading is accurate or not. As
	a consequence, the third operator takes an action according to the protocol that results in a nuclear
	meltdown. State all hazards in this description and draw a fault tree that explains the sources leading
	to a catastrophic outcome.

		hazards:
			raised threshold
			hot coffee
			injured operator causing distraction
			faulty sensor
			3rd operator not being able to see what is happening with the other 2
			>>>>> inability to identify if a sensor is faulty!!!!!


	Explain how a systems approach might have eliminated the catastrophic outcome in (d).

		a systems approach wouldhave hollistically identified the issues relating to communication between subsystems and enabled FMEA to be applied to
		identify and mitigate the risks during the design process
		>>>>> and would have considered people's actions within the system!!!!!


A patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump enables a patient to self-administer pain relief
medicine. Such a PCA pump is set up by a nurse, indicating medication dosage and schedule among
other things, and subsequently used by the patient. A support engineer is responsible for ensuring the
software is up to date and that the settings are cleared between each patient. Research has shown that
a frequent source of patient injury or death is due to the user interface being difficult to use, resulting
in the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to specify a set of requirements that a user
interface for a PCA pump must comply with.

A design team is tasked to create a user interface for a PCA pump.

	Derive a solution-neutral problem statement for this design problem.

		devise a means to allow a patient to control their PCA pump in accordance with FDA regulations and capable of being used by all patients
		at a certain cost and being compatible with certain systems
		>>>>> safe!!!!!


	Identify a system boundary for this design problem and motivate the choice of boundary.

		patient, pump and medication, user interface and computer running it, power supply, hospital environment and staff
		>>>>> and regulations!!!!!


	Suggest a user-centred design process suitable for this design problem. Motivate the choice of
	design process with reference to other user-centred design processes that are less suitable.

		huamn factors engineering - very important to consider what human mistakes and slips may occur
		safety critical
		more agile/trial and error approach would not be safe


	Propose a risk management strategy for assessing, monitoring, and communicating risk for the
	new PCA pump user interface design.

		HAZOP and risk matrix or FMEA repeated quarterly


	One FDA requirement is the following: “Clearing of the pump settings and resetting of the pump
	shall require confirmation.” Explain why this requirement is ambiguous and raises questions about
	the user interface design for a PCA pump that are not explicit in the requirement.

		not clear if confirmation is required for clearing pump settings or resetting or both only
		>>>>> raises questions about the order of those operations and if it needs to be constrained, or what the relationship is between those operations!!!!!


design patterns
	
	composite
		
		allows a group of objects to have the same interface as a single object
		but can be too powerful - hard to control which objects can be added to a group
		can client code needs to be able to distinguish groups from induvidual objects eg to be able to add/remove items


	decorator
		
		allows an object to have additional functionality added while keeping the same interface
		reduces proliferation of classes, is able to add functionality to all subclasses
		can have box in a box problem
		can be cumbersome to add many features to an object with many decorations
		obfuscates identity of objects - harder to debug
		>>>>> add behaviour to all classes in a heirarchy without changing base class or subclass code!!!!!


	observer
		
		allows many different classes objects to maintain a consistent view on the state of an object of interest
		computational load can escalate if unchecked - if rate of events is high and lots of cimputation results from each event


	MVC

		seperates data, management of the data and user's view of and interaction with the data


Why is encapsulation important

	hides complexity of implementation of operations but exposes simpler interface
	allows the system to be viewed at many levels of abstraction
	makes complexity more manageable
	allows decoupling which makes extending/modifying software easier
	>>>>> makes debugging easier!!!!!


Why are getters and setters used?

	to implement constraints checking
	to control concurrent access to data
	to allow different views into single data source
	hide actual data source eg database
		but shouldnt have heavy computation/latency behind them


What is polymorphism and how does it help?

	seperates declaration of functionality from specifics of implementation
	allows a single object to be interfaced with at different levels of abstraction
		can request the same action to be performed by different objects and it be performed in different ways
		allows simplifying generalisations to be made and still support different behaviours and implementations
	increases extensibility of code
