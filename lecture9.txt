human computer interface

computers are tools

humans are very complex
	some of our abilities are well understood and can be controlled
	some arent well understood

everyone has differences and different experiences
	need to account for these in HCI
	good design requries empathy

computers are complex
	hard to design for this complexity

need to understand the system
	take into accout full socio economic context
	need to integrate design into full system

design is hard
	no perfect design - always tradeoffs
	need to specify problem well - easy to introduce bad requirements early in process

HCI requires a unique comination of skills that arent lectured
	software hardware analytical skills and user research skills

empirical problems
	use accounts of phenomena when understanding is lacking
conceptual problems
	connect concepts using theory
constructive problems


HCI practicioners
	understand users and interactions
		behavioural science
	evaluate systems
	communicate with stakeholders

fundamentals
	user interacts

human centered
	need to understand and engage with users
	ethical considerations of systems

	systems should match people not other way around
	create systems that make things better for people

pragmatic - utility
hedonic - pleasure
self determination - users need self determination, autonomy, competance and relatedness
multiple resources - tasks compete for attention
fitts law - speed accuracy tradeoff
social info processing theory - users adapt social behaviour to account for lack of social cues in computer mediated communication

Interaction
	system adapts to user, user adapts to system

UIs
	command line -> gui

Design
	change the world by designing HCIs
	envision things as they could be

Engineering
	technical knowhow
	emergent qualities eg performance, safety, robustness
	use theory and practice

Evaluation
	verification and validation (check requirements) and testing

	use multiple methods

	then feedback -> iterative design

interactive systems are difficult to use
	normal people couldnt use it

	frustrations using the computer dissuaded people from using the systems
	even worse for old/disabled people or those from other cultures

	even doors are hard to use

egocentric fallacy
	not all people are like us
	intuition can only go so far and is often misleading

being human centered is the right thing to do
	Dieter Rams: “Indifference towards people and the reality they live in is the one and only cardinal sin in design”

HCI has huge financial value
	several fold returns in investments in HCI

HCI can change the future
	discover new ways to use products and enjoy new services
	market pull or tech push

Principles
	foundational ideas to explain
	eg direct manipulation
		The principle states that computational objects must be presented on a
		display and acted on by the user through direct, reversible, and incremental
		actions with immediate feedback
	
pluralism of methods
	many different approaches, all needed to build the best system

essential insights from research

many of the most successful systems come from HCI research
	and many HCI problems have answers
	but not always the answer

understanding people
	ethnography of system admins
	looked into sysadmins work
	existing systems were so opaque that sysadmins wasted time troubleshooting and duplicating work making custom scripts

supple++
	callibration task and then reengineer UI to user's needs

value sensitive AI
	currently we use algorithm centric process
	can we fit algorithms into wider context to uphold values

alice and bob cant encrypt
	PGP too hard to use
	UI principles insufficent to ensure usable security

AAC App
	released on app store and got feedback through the app
	accessed users across the world
	reached users that were hard to interact with otherwise

computing is powerful
UIs control and tame it
HCI is concerned with people, understanding interaction and benefits to users
you are not the user
HCI offers disciplined approach to hard problems in design
