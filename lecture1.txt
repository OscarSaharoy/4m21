Concepts Behind Software Design

Definitions
	Software
		collection of computer programs and data that tell a computer what to do and how

	Engineering
		the way something has been desgined and built

	Software Engineering
		methods, techniques and tools that could be applied to design, build and maintain software

What is a computer
	everything


Software Types
	app - consumer software
	in car software - OS, platform for car apps
	application server - distributed concurrent software system
	GPS chip - embedded software
	Navigation satellite - system control software

London Ambulance Dispatch System Rollout
	1991-1992
	didn't consult any users
	monolithic design, build and rollout, rather than automating small parts one at a time
	few hours after rollout, lost track of ambulance status, calls got lost, clogged up - memory leaks, shut down after 6 days
	46 deaths
	important case study & example

Therac 25
	overdosed people with radiation
	error without info, caused repeated dosage


"Software entities are more complex for their size than perhaps any
other human construct... Many of the classical problems of
developing software products derive from this essential complexity
and its nonlinear increases with size."
	Fred Brooks, “No Silver Bullet – Essence and Accident in Software Engineering”

Unprecedented Scale and Complexity
	2 trillion – web requests served daily by Akamai CDN

Impossible to know in advnace everything needed
	users don't know what they want
	developers don't know how users will use it
	only thing we know is that things will change


	There are known knowns; there are things we know we know.
	We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we
	know there are some things we do not know.
	But there are also unknown unknowns – there are things we
	do not know we don't know.
		Former United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld

Make Better Mistakes Tomrrow
Have Happy (Alive) Users
No Silver Bullet
Build For Change
Communicate Clearly
Test Continuously, Test Everything
Choose The Tools For The Job

In short, software is eating the world...
